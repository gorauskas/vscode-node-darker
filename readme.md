# Nord Darker

This is a darker version of the original Nord theme for VSCode from [here](https://github.com/nordtheme/visual-studio-code). Darker in this context means that the Polar Night color pallete is a little darker to create higher contrast between background and foreground colors. Everything else remains the same.

The original colors:

```
  #2E3440 #3B4252 #434C5E #4C566A
```

The darker colors:

```
  #242833 #2E3440 #3B4252 #434C5E
```
